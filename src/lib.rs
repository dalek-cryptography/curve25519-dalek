//! # curve25519-dalek
//!
//! **A Rust implementation of field and group operations on an Edwards curve
//! over GF(2^255 - 19).**
//!
//! **[SPOILER ALERT]** The Twelfth Doctor's first encounter with the Daleks is
//! in his second full episode, "Into the Dalek".  A beleaguered ship of the
//! "Combined Galactic Resistance" has discovered a broken Dalek that has
//! turned "good", desiring to kill all other Daleks.  The Doctor, Clara and a
//! team of soldiers are miniaturized and enter the Dalek, which the Doctor
//! names Rusty.  They repair the damage, but accidentally restore it to its
//! original nature, causing it to go on the rampage and alert the Dalek fleet
//! to the whereabouts of the rebel ship.  However, the Doctor manages to
//! return Rusty to its previous state by linking his mind with the Dalek's:
//! Rusty shares the Doctor's view of the universe's beauty, but also his deep
//! hatred of the Daleks.  Rusty destroys the other Daleks and departs the
//! ship, determined to track down and bring an end to the Dalek race.
